I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University, working with [Ciprian Crainiceanu](http://www.ciprianstats.org). Prior to joining Hopkins, I obtained Ph.D. in Biostatistics from UCLA. 

My current research focuses on developing flexible and scalable <ins>functional data analysis</ins> methods for modeling modern health data collected via <ins>wearable and implantable technologies</ins>. My work is motivated by problems arising from both clinical and public health research, including high-resolution hemodynamics data collected during cardiac surgery and large-scale physical activity data collected by the US CDC and UK Biobank using accelerometers. 

During PhD, I developed statistical methods and reproducible software to bring <ins>uncertainty quantification</ins> to big data and complex models. Projects include 1) [scaling up inference for mixed models to the ultra-big data setting (> 200 million observations)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sam.11563?af=R); 2) [enabling statistical inference for complex machine learning tasks such as constrained and regularized regression, matrix completion, and sparse low-rank matrix regression.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2024.2308821)

<!-- I have collaborated with investigators from a variety of departments/institutions, including the Department of Epidemiology and Department of Anesthesiology from Hopkins, and the Department of Medicine, Stein Eye Institute, Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center from UCLA. -->

In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, exploring fresh music, and reading the [Three Hundred Tang Poems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Hundred_Tang_Poems). 
<!-- I am also the founder and co-host of the Two Nearest Neighbors podcast (link to: [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/3EoHTgSLU5l1qZfZB3nwwK), [Apple Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/two-nearest-neighbors/id1600839339)) with [Nicholas Marco](https://ndmarco.github.io), where we talk to professors about current topics in statistics, machine learning, and big data. -->
