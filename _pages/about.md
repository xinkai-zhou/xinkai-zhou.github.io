I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University, mentored by [Ciprian Crainiceanu](http://www.ciprianstats.org). 

My research focuses on developing flexible and scalable statistical modeling and inference tools for large-scale, high-dimensional, and repeatedly collected modern health data. Two application areas of focus are hemodynamics data collected during surgery and physical activity data collected using accelerometers. 

Prior to joining Hopkins, I received PhD in Biostatistics from UCLA, mentored by [Hua Zhou](http://hua-zhou.github.io). Before that, I was a senior statistician at the UCLA Department of Medicine Statistics Core led by [David Elashoff](https://domstat.med.ucla.edu/pages/david-elashoff). 

I have collaborated with investigators from a variety of departments/institutions, including the Department of Epidemiology and Department of Anesthesiology from Hopkins, and the Department of Medicine, Stein Eye Institute, Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center from UCLA.

In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, exploring fresh music, and reading the [Three Hundred Tang Poems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Hundred_Tang_Poems). 
<!-- I am also the founder and co-host of the Two Nearest Neighbors podcast (link to: [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/3EoHTgSLU5l1qZfZB3nwwK), [Apple Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/two-nearest-neighbors/id1600839339)) with [Nicholas Marco](https://ndmarco.github.io), where we talk to professors about current topics in statistics, machine learning, and big data. -->
