I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University, working with [Ciprian Crainiceanu](http://www.ciprianstats.org). Before joining Hopkins, I obtained my Ph.D. in Biostatistics from UCLA, working with [Hua Zhou](https://ph.ucla.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/hua-zhou). 

My current research focuses on developing flexible and scalable <ins>functional data analysis</ins> methods for modeling modern health data collected via <ins>wearable and implantable technologies</ins>. My work is motivated by problems arising from both clinical and public health research, including high-resolution hemodynamic data from cardiac surgeries and large-scale physical activity data collected by the US CDC and UK Biobank using accelerometers. For more information about specific projects, please visit the [Research](/research/) page.

During Ph.D., I developed statistical methods and reproducible software to enable <ins>uncertainty quantification</ins> for big data and complex models. Key projects include 1) [scaling up inference for mixed models to ultra-large datasets (> 200 million observations)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sam.11563?af=R); 2) [enabling statistical inference for complex machine learning tasks such as constrained and regularized regression, matrix completion, and sparse low-rank matrix regression](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2024.2308821) by integrating concepts from optimization and Bayesian inference.

<!-- In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, reading the [Three Hundred Tang Poems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Hundred_Tang_Poems), and exploring music from around the world.  -->

<!-- I am also the founder and co-host of the Two Nearest Neighbors podcast (link to: [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/3EoHTgSLU5l1qZfZB3nwwK), [Apple Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/two-nearest-neighbors/id1600839339)) with [Nicholas Marco](https://ndmarco.github.io), where we talk to professors about current topics in statistics, machine learning, and big data. -->
